mkinfo is a program that will generate "missing" files after partially
backing up a DVD with the (unaffiliated) program "dvdauthor".

DVDs have a file "VIDEO_TS.IFO" inside a directory called "VIDEO_TS".  
This file tells the DVD player about what titlesets are on the DVD.

Since "dvdauthor" only copies, and does not generate anything, when it 
is told to back up only part of a DVD (e.g. the main feature), it will
copy only the titleset.  Copying the "VIDEO_TS.IFO" file would not make
sense, since that file would refer to titlesets that were not backed up.

However, that partial DVD image is not always playable because many software
DVD players look for that missing file.

This program analyzes the data available, and generates an appropriate
VIDEO_TS.IFO.

The program is adapted from "dvdauthor".
